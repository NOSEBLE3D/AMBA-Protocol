## Project Overview
Implementation of a complete AXI4 protocol interface consisting of both master and slave modules targeting the Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC platform. The design supports full AXI4 specification with comprehensive burst operations and independent channel architecture.

## Architecture Details

### 1. Channel Implementation
The design implements all five AXI4 channels:

#### Write Channels:
- **Write Address Channel (AW)**
  - 32-bit address width (AWADDR[31:0])
  - Burst length support (AWLEN[7:0])
  - Size configuration (AWSIZE[2:0])
  - Burst type selection (AWBURST[1:0])
  - Handshaking signals (AWVALID, AWREADY)

- **Write Data Channel (W)**
  - 32-bit data width (WDATA[31:0])
  - Last transfer indication (WLAST)
  - Handshaking signals (WVALID, WREADY)

- **Write Response Channel (B)**
  - Response signaling (BRESP)
  - Handshaking signals (BVALID, BREADY)

#### Read Channels:
- **Read Address Channel (AR)**
  - 32-bit address width (ARADDR[31:0])
  - Burst length support (ARLEN[7:0])
  - Size configuration (ARSIZE[2:0])
  - Burst type selection (ARBURST[1:0])
  - Handshaking signals (ARVALID, ARREADY)

- **Read Data Channel (R)**
  - 32-bit data width (RDATA[31:0])
  - Response signaling (RRESP)
  - Last transfer indication (RLAST)
  - Handshaking signals (RVALID, RREADY)

### 2. State Machine Implementation
Both master and slave modules implement sophisticated state machines:

#### Master States:
- IDLE: Default state awaiting transaction requests
- ACTIVE: Active transaction processing
- END: Transaction completion handling

#### Slave States:
- Similar three-state implementation with dedicated state machines for each channel
- Independent operation of read and write paths

### 3. Burst Support
Implements all AXI4 burst types:
- FIXED: Fixed address bursts
- INCR: Incrementing address bursts
- WRAP: Wrapping bursts with boundary handling

### 4. Memory Interface
Slave module includes:
- 100-word internal memory array
- Address calculation functions (Wrap, Incr)
- Burst boundary handling

### 5. Control Features
- Full-duplex operation support
- Independent read/write paths
- Zero-latency pipelining
- Transaction completion signaling
- Burst counter management

## Physical Implementation
